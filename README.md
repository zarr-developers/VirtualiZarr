## Cloud-Optimize your Scientific Data as Virtual Zarr stores, using xarray syntax.

The best way to distribute large scientific datasets is via the Cloud, in [Cloud-Optimized formats](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/) [^1]. But often this data is stuck in archival pre-Cloud file formats such as netCDF.

**VirtualiZarr[^2] makes it easy to create "Virtual" Zarr stores, allowing performant access to archival data as if it were in the Cloud-Optimized [Zarr format](https://zarr.dev/), _without duplicating any data_.**

Please see the [documentation](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

### Features

* Create virtual references pointing to bytes inside a archival file with [`open_virtual_dataset`](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#opening-files-as-virtual-datasets),
* Supports a [range of archival file formats](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-virtualizarr-and-kerchunk-compare), including netCDF4 and HDF5,
* [Combine data from multiple files](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#combining-virtual-datasets) into one larger store using [xarray's combining functions](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/combining.html), such as [`xarray.concat`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.concat.html),
* Commit the virtual references to storage either using the [Kerchunk references](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/spec.html) specification or the [Icechunk](https://icechunk.io/) transactional storage engine.
* Users access the virtual dataset using [`xarray.open_dataset`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.open_dataset.html#xarray.open_dataset).

### Inspired by Kerchunk

VirtualiZarr grew out of [discussions](https://github.com/fsspec/kerchunk/issues/377) on the [Kerchunk repository](https://github.com/fsspec/kerchunk), and is an attempt to provide the game-changing power of kerchunk but in a zarr-native way, and with a familiar array-like API.

You now have a choice between using VirtualiZarr and Kerchunk: VirtualiZarr provides [almost all the same features](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-virtualizarr-and-kerchunk-compare) as Kerchunk.

### Development Status and Roadmap

VirtualiZarr version 1 (mostly) achieves [feature parity](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-virtualizarr-and-kerchunk-compare) with kerchunk's logic for combining datasets, providing an easier way to manipulate kerchunk references in memory and generate kerchunk reference files on disk.

Future VirtualiZarr development will focus on generalizing and upstreaming useful concepts into the Zarr specification, the Zarr-Python library, Xarray, and possibly some new packages.

We have a lot of ideas, including:
- [Zarr v3 support](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr/issues/17)
- [Zarr-native on-disk chunk manifest format](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/287)
- ["Virtual concatenation"](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/288) of separate Zarr arrays
- ManifestArrays as an [intermediate layer in-memory](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr/issues/71) in Zarr-Python
- [Separating CF-related Codecs from xarray](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr/issues/68#issuecomment-2197682388)
- [Generating references without kerchunk](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr/issues/78)

If you see other opportunities then we would love to hear your ideas!

### Credits

This package was originally developed by [Tom Nicholas](https://github.com/TomNicholas) whilst working at [[C]Worthy](cworthy.org), who deserve credit for allowing him to prioritise a generalizable open-source solution to the dataset virtualization problem. VirtualiZarr is now a community-owned multi-stakeholder project.
