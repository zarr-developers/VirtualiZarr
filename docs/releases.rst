Release notes
=============

.. _v1.2.1:

v1.2.1 (unreleased)
-------------------

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a ``.nbytes`` accessor method which displays the bytes needed to hold the virtual references in memory.
  (:issue:`167`, :pull:`227`) By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
- Sync with Icechunk v0.1.0a8  (:pull:`368`) By `Matthew Iannucci <https://github.com/mpiannucci>`. This also adds support
  for the `to_icechunk` method to add timestamps as checksums when writing virtual references to an icechunk store. This
  is useful for ensuring that virtual references are not stale when reading from an icechunk store, which can happen if the
  underlying data has changed since the virtual references were written.
- Add ``group=None`` keyword-only parameter to the
  ``VirtualiZarrDatasetAccessor.to_icechunk`` method to allow writing to a nested group
  at a specified group path (rather than defaulting to the root group, when no group is
  specified).  (:issue:`341`) By `Chuck Daniels <https://github.com/chuckwondo>`_.

Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Passing ``group=None`` (the default) to ``open_virtual_dataset`` for a file with multiple groups no longer raises an error, instead it gives you the root group.
  This new behaviour is more consistent with ``xarray.open_dataset``.
  (:issue:`336`, :pull:`338`) By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
- Indexes are now created by default for any loadable one-dimensional coordinate variables.
  Also a warning is no longer thrown when ``indexes=None`` is passed to ``open_virtual_dataset``, and the recommendations in the docs updated to match.
  This also means that ``xarray.combine_by_coords`` will now work when the necessary dimension coordinates are specified in ``loadable_variables``.
  (:issue:`18`, :pull:`357`, :pull:`358`) By `Tom Nicholas <https://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.
- The ``append_dim`` and ``last_updated_at`` parameters of the
  ``VirtualiZarrDatasetAccessor.to_icechunk`` method are now keyword-only parameters,
  rather than positional or keyword.  This change is breaking _only_ where arguments for
  these parameters are currently given positionally.  (:issue:`341`) By
  `Chuck Daniels <https://github.com/chuckwondo>`_.

Deprecations

.. _v1.0.0:

v1.0.0 (9th July 2024)

Future VirtualiZarr development will focus on generalizing and upstreaming useful concepts into the Zarr specification, the Zarr-Python library, Xarray, and possibly some new packages. See the roadmap in the documentation for details.
