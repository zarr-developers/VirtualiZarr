# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! We ask only that all contributors follow the [Zarr Developers Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zarr-developers/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing code

Before opening a PR to contribute code you should check that your changes work by running the test suite locally.

We use [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/) to manage dependencies, which you'll want to install to get started.

To run the tests in the default test environment, run:

```bash
pixi run --environment test test-no-network
```

As shown below, you can run additional tests that require downloading files over the network.
Use the `test-no-network` task shown above instead if you want the tests to run faster or
you have no internet access:

```bash
pixi run --environment test
```

You can also run tests in other environments:

```bash
pixi run --environment min-deps test # Test with the minimal set of dependencies installed
pixi run --environment upstream test # Test with unreleased versions of upstream libraries

```

Further, the `pytest-cov` plugin is a test dependency, so you can generate a test
coverage report locally, if you wish (CI will automatically do so).  Here are some
examples:

```bash
pixi run --environment test-cov              # Terminal report showing missing coverage
pixi run --environment test-html-cov         # HTML report written to htmlcov/index.html
```

## Contributing documentation

Whilst the CI will build the updated documentation for each PR, it can also be useful to check that the documentation has rendered as expected by building it locally.

### Build the documentation locally

```bash
pixi install --environment docs
pixi run docs
```

### Access the documentation locally

Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser (on MacOS you can do this from the terminal using `open docs/_build/html/index.html`).

## Making a release

Anyone with commit privileges to the repository can issue a release, and you should feel free to issue a release at any point in time when all the CI tests on `main` are passing.

1. Decide on the release version number for the new release, following the [EffVer](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/) versioning scheme (e.g., releasing v0.2.0 as the next release after v0.1.0 denotes that ‚Äúsome small effort may be required to make sure this version works for you‚Äù).
2. Write a high-level summary of the changes in this release, and write it into the release notes in `docs/releases.rst`. Create and merge a PR which adds the summary and also changes the release notes to say today's date and the version number of the new release. Don't add the blank template for future releases yet.
3. Navigate to the [https://github.com/zarr-developers/virtualizarr/releases](https://github.com/zarr-developers/virtualizarr/releases) releases page.
4. Select 'Draft a new release'.
5. Select 'Choose a tag', then 'Create a new tag'
6. Enter the name for the new tag (i.e. the release version number).
7. Click 'Generate Release Notes' to draft notes based on merged pull requests, and paste the same release summary you wrote earlier at the top.
8. Edit the draft release notes for consistency.
9. Select 'Publish' to publish the release. This should automatically upload the new release to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/virtualizarr/) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/virtualizarr).
10. Check that this has run successfully (PyPI should show the new version number very quickly, but conda-forge might take several hours).
11. Create and merge a PR to add a new empty section to the `docs/releases.rst` for the next release in the future. See [this commit](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr/commit/e3912f08e22f2e3230af6eb1a2aacb5728822fa1) for an example (you can assume the next release will be numbered `vX.Y.Z+1`, but the number doesn't actually matter).
12. (Optional) Advertise the release on social media üì£
